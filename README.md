# Dazzer

Makes your AI check what you already know before answering, and save what settles instead of
losing it when the conversation ends.

## Install

Two lines in most tools. The same plugin, the same files — only the command changes.

### Claude Code

```
/plugin marketplace add dazzer-io/dazzer-plugin
/plugin install dazzer@dazzer
```

Typed into Claude itself, not into your shell.

**Using the desktop app?** Install it from a terminal with the same two lines. The app and the
terminal share one set of settings, so it appears in the app on your next conversation. The
install command does not exist inside the app, so this genuinely needs a terminal once — even if
you never otherwise open one.

### Codex — OpenAI's coding tool

```
codex plugin marketplace add dazzer-io/dazzer-plugin
codex plugin add dazzer@dazzer
```

Codex asks you to approve a plugin's reminders before it will run them. If nothing appears in the
run history described below, that approval is the first thing to check.

### GitHub Copilot

```
copilot plugin marketplace add dazzer-io/dazzer-plugin
copilot plugin install dazzer@dazzer
```

All three reminders work here, quietly, the same way they do in Claude's.

### Antigravity — Google's coding tool

It has no store to install from, so point it at a downloaded copy:

```
git clone https://github.com/dazzer-io/dazzer-plugin.git
agy plugin install ./dazzer-plugin/plugins/dazzer
```

Two of the three reminders work. Being put back on track after a long conversation forgets itself
does not — that moment does not exist in this tool at all, so nothing we add can fix it.

### Cursor

```
cursor-agent plugin marketplace add https://github.com/dazzer-io/dazzer-plugin.git
```

Then install Dazzer from the **Customize** panel in the sidebar.

One difference you will see rather than read about: Cursor has no way for a plugin to speak
privately to the AI at the end of a reply. It only accepts a message and submits it as though you
had typed it, so on Cursor the save prompt is visible in your conversation. Everything works; it
just is not silent.

### Reaching your Brain

Everything above adds the **reminders**. They need your Brain to already be reachable from that
tool. If it is not, each tool has its own one-time sign-in — and in Claude you can get it from the
same place:

```
/plugin install dazzer-connect@dazzer
```

Skip that if Dazzer already shows as connected. Installing it again would replace a working
connection with one that needs signing in.

### Where reminders cannot run at all

Claude's chat apps and the web app have no moment at the end of a reply for anything to run. There
the bundled skill carries the same intent as plain text, and reaching your Brain works exactly the
same.

### What has actually been tried

Four of the five were installed from this repository into a throwaway copy of the real tool, and
the reminder was watched firing: Claude Code, Codex, Copilot and Antigravity. **Cursor was not** —
every Cursor command needs a signed-in account. Cursor support rests on their published
specification plus one of their own official plugins using the identical mechanism.

## Two pieces, on purpose

**`dazzer`** is the part that changes behaviour: the reminders, the capture sweep, and the skill.
It adds no connection of its own, so installing it can never disturb one you already have.

**`dazzer-connect`** is the connection, for people who have not already got one.

They are separate because bundling them broke the first minute for anyone already connected: a
bundled connection carries its own sign-in, so installing replaced a working connection with an
unauthenticated one and the Brain went dark until the sign-in was noticed. Someone who already
connected through the app should never have to re-authenticate to get a few reminders.

The trade is honest and worth stating: without `dazzer-connect`, we cannot tell your traffic
apart from a hand-configured connection. A plugin that disconnects someone is the worse outcome.

## What it does

**Tells the AI to check before answering.** Every prompt carries a short reminder to look in your
Brain first rather than answering from assumption.

**Tells it to save what settled.** At the end of a reply, when enough real work has accumulated,
it prompts a capture sweep. What actually gets saved is the model's judgment against your Brain's
own rules — this plugin never decides that and never writes anything itself.

**Restores your place after a context reset.** When a long session compacts, nothing reconnects
and the AI is never re-oriented. This is the one moment your Brain cannot reach on its own, so
the plugin covers it.

## What it never does

It never talks to Dazzer directly, never holds credentials, and never decides what is worth
saving. It only taps the model at the right moment; the model acts through the connection it
already owns and reads the current rules from your Brain at the moment it acts.

That is deliberate: it means the rules can change in your Brain and take effect immediately,
without you updating anything.

## Where the rules live

In your Brain, served live — `brain.door.entrance`, `brain.capture.protocol`, and
`brain.working.memory.contract`. This repository holds triggers, not teaching.

## Tuning

Set any of these in your environment to override the shipped value. The shipped values live
in `plugins/dazzer/config/capture.defaults`, which is read as plain data and never run.

| Variable | Default | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `DAZZER_CAPTURE_THRESHOLD` | `80` | How much new conversation accumulates before a save is prompted. Raise it for fewer interruptions, lower it to capture more eagerly. |
| `DAZZER_CAPTURE_STATE_TTL_DAYS` | `30` | How long a finished session's marker is kept before being tidied away. |
| `DAZZER_CAPTURE_RECEIPTS_MAX_BYTES` | `262144` | How large the record of what this did may grow before the old one is rolled aside. |
| `DAZZER_CAPTURE_MAX_INPUT_BYTES` | `100000` | A guard against an unreasonably large message, not a tuning dial. There is no reason to change it. |
| `DAZZER_TOOL` | works itself out | Which tool this is running inside, recorded in the run history. Only set it somewhere the automatic answer is wrong. |

A bad value never takes effect and never causes an error: anything that is not a whole
number falls back to the shipped default, silently and on purpose.

## Checking it is actually working

The plugin writes one line every time it runs, recording when, what it decided and why —
never any of your conversation. To see it:

```
cat "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA:-$HOME/.dazzer}/capture/receipts.jsonl" | tail
```

An empty file, or no file at all, means the plugin has never run — which is worth knowing,
because that failure is otherwise completely silent.

## Uninstall

Remove the part that changes behaviour:

```
/plugin uninstall dazzer@dazzer
```

If you also installed the connection, and you want that gone too:

```
/plugin uninstall dazzer-connect@dazzer
```

Leave that second one in place if Dazzer is still how you reach your Brain — removing it
takes the connection with it.
